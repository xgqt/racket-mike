@title[#:tag "mike - about"]{About}


I used to use @link["https://www.gnu.org/software/make/" "GNU Make"]
to speed up development of my Racket projects.
I started generalizing the
@link["https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html"
      "Makefiles"]
and my project layout to make it so
I could use the same Makefile in many projects
and with known to me commands (targets).

But then, I thought that it's not ideal to include a file in each of my projects
that would be mostly the same. So, I decided to, in the spirit of Racket,
rewrite Make in Racket but make it do only what my Makefile used to do.

The Makefile I used to use can be found left over in my projects or in the
@link["https://gitlab.com/xgqt/s-exp/-/blob/master/buildsystems/Makefile"
      "s-exp"]
project repository. That file is released into the
@link["https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/"
      "Public Domain"]
(or under
   @link["https://spdx.org/licenses/CC0-1.0.html" "CC0-1.0"]
   if your country does not have
   @link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain" "Public Domain"]).


@section{Quickstart}


@subsection{Raco}

Install @link["https://gitlab.com/xgqt/racket-mike" "Racket-Mike"]
from remote
@link["https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/mike" "Racket package catalog"]
by executing:
@commandline{raco pkg install mike}

If you have cloned the repository instead use:
@commandline{raco pkg install --name mike}


@subsection{Mike}

If you want to install @exec{mike} via itself
(from within the cloned repository):
@commandline{racket ./mike/main.rkt PACKAGE_NAME=mike install setup}

or if you already have @exec{mike} installed and you wish to update it:
@commandline{git pull}
@commandline{mike PACKAGE_NAME=mike reinstall setup}


@subsection{PATH}

After installation make sure the launch of @exec{mike}
is available in your @envvar{PATH}.


@subsection{Exe}

Another way to use @exec{mike} is to create a executable binary from itself
and then put it in a directory included in @envvar{PATH},
ie.: @filepath{/usr/bin}
@commandline{racket ./mike/main.rkt PACKAGE_NAME=mike clean exe}
@commandline{sudo cp ./bin/mike /usr/bin}


@section{Upstream}

@link["https://gitlab.com/xgqt/racket-mike" "GitLab"].
